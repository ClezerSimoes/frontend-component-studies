# Web Components Study

This repository is dedicated to studying and building common web application components using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, without the use of external libraries or frameworks.

## 📚 Purpose

The goal is to improve front-end development skills by recreating essential UI components from scratch, focusing on:

- Clean and semantic HTML
- Responsive and modern CSS
- Interactive behavior with vanilla JavaScript

## 🧩 Components

Each component is placed in its own folder with isolated files. Below are examples of what will be covered:

- ✅ Slider / Carousel
- ✅ Dropdown Menu
- ✅ Modal / Popup
- ✅ Accordion
- ✅ Tabs
- ✅ Tooltip
- ✅ Toast Notification
- ✅ Burger Menu (Mobile Navigation)
- ✅ Form Validation

> components will be added as the study progresses.
